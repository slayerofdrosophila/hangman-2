After overwriting the README for the fourth time, I have given up on rewriting it again.       
I barely know how the code works myself but if you ask I will try my best to walk it through on a call or something.      
(and its not a "haha its magic" but because my dad wrote a good amount of it and i was basically transcribing it xdxd)

todo:      
make the acctual game: (turns, damage)                                      
making the thing playable on smaller screen when there are more than 4 people                   
rooms?     
usernames      
word filters / categories + character limits (customizable)         
accounts (sql??)            
actual art              



honestly i shouldve wrote the server stuff in python instead... big sads
