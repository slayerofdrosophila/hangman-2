hi person

if i dont know you pls leave

to start it i go to terminal in the folder and do parcel .\src\index.html --port 8080

the fun stuff is in /src/
the thing being worked on is mainscene.ts (which is the game "scene", other scenes can be created and used if needed)


ok so what it is at right now:
phaser makes things called "scenes" which are put on "canvases?" and like put in on the screen somehow. there is currently only 1 scene. this scene, MainScene, is where there is a bunch of blanked out words. when you move over them and type a letter, 9it, like, guesses the word. incorrect guesses work wrong, but they work. they are also kept in another ... sprite(?) underneath the main one.

todo:

assign wrong guess "damage" to player 0

online multiplayer functionality

main menu scene

anything else
